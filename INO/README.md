We have decided to approach the following strategy:

Before starting to code in python and work in the raspberry pi environment, we have decided that an arduino board will make our life easier for some experiments.

Thus, we would like to clearly state the fact that the final embedded system will NOT be written using the arduino environment, and instead by using the raspberrian interfaces.
